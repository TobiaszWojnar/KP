List 6 - Implement in Java and C++ Binary Search Tree on generic types.


Installation and running
----
Compile:
* Java
```
    cd java/src
    javac *.java
```
* Cpp
```
   cd cpp
    make
    clean 
```
Run:
* for testing implementation without GUI:
```
    java TestImplementation
    cos cpp
```
* for running server and GUI:
```
    java MyServer
    java TreeGUI
```
Requirements
----

* [x] for 3.0
    * implement Binary Search Tree on generic types in Java and C++.
    * Functions: insert, search, delete, draw (printing tree inOrder)

* [x] for 4.0
    * Add GUI in Java

* [x] for 5.0
    * Java program should work in client-server architecture.
    * Client should be window app that sends requests to server and displays results.
    * Server should compute all requests.
* Generate documentation

What I Learned
----
* Declaring and using parameterized classes
* Algorithms for inserting, searching, deleting elements on binary trees
* Better understanding of listeners
* Better understanding of Swing (JScrollPane, JScrollBar, JTree, JSplitPane)
* client-server architecture
* Using sockets
