### List 3 - Calculate surface area and circumference - Extending classes

#### Requirements
* Create class calculating surface area and circumference of geometric figures, 
  implement abstract class and class hierarchy
* Create abstract class `Figure` with methods `surface` and `circumference`
* `Figure` should be extended by `Circle`, `Quadrangle`, `Pentagon` and `Hexagon`
* `Quadrangle` should be extended by `Square`, `Rhombus`, `Rectangle`.
* Handle exceptions and bad data
* Implemented in Java nad C++

#### What I Learned
* implementing interfaces, abstract classes
* extending classes
* basic documenting in Javadoc
* basic tests
