### List 1 - create class PrimeNumbers creating table of prime numbers smaller than n
#### Requirements
* implemented in Java nad C++
#### What I Learned
* implementing classes

### List 2 - Implement class translating between arabic and roman numbers
#### Requirements
* handle exceptions and bad data
* implemented in Java nad C++
#### What I Learned
* using exceptions

### List 3 - create class calculating surface area and circumference of geometric figures
#### Requirements
* implemented in Java nad C++
* implement abstract class and class hierarchy
* handle exceptions and bad data
#### What I Learned
* implementing interfaces, abstract classes
* basics of Javadoc
* basics of testing

### List 4 - create basic paint app
#### Requirements
* enable creating and modifying geometric figures
* saving to file
* add popup Info
* generate documentation with javadoc and doxygen
* don't use package
* don't use javafx
#### What I Learned
* making GUI
* using Swing
* very painfully difference between `=+` and `+=`
* implementing interfaces and methods 
* using Listeners
* generating doxygen documentation

### List 5 -  using threads create simulation with flickering rectangles
#### Requirements
* Simulate a board of `n` x `m` rectangles with random initial color.
Each rectangle is thread that after time `t` changes it's color (t = random number of milliseconds in range [0.5k, 1.5k]).
* rectangle changes its color:
    * with probability `p` to random
    * with probability `p-1` to average of its neighbours (treat board as 2d torus)
* take care of synchronization to avoid conflicts
* add ability to stop each thread by clicking on rectangle
* add rescaling application
#### What I Learned
* using labels and textFields in swing
* using threads
* stopping and restarting threads

### List 6
#### Requirements
